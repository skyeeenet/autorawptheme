# Wordpress theme *"Autora"*
##### The task was to transfer a static HTML theme to the WordPress CMS.
During work, custom post types and taxonomies were created. Also, a script was written for outputting bread crumbs without using a plug-in, as well as a pagination for the archive pages of custom post types and for single entries.

**The following plugins were used:**
* Advanced Custom Fields
* Twitter Feeds
* Instagram Feed
* Smart Slider
* Contact Form 7

I also developed my own widgets to simplify editing the topic. Since the topic included the dynamic output of data from instagram and twitter, the corresponding plugins were used to solve this problem.
